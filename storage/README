Data information
-------------------

We here produce some exapmples of the input files for RADMC-3D, in order to skip the time-consuming process 
of gathering the input files. However, if you use these files, please do not forget to cite the original papers.


Dust Opacity:
dustkappa_silicate.inp is taken from the default opacity table used in RADMC-3D. 
This is for Amorphous Olivine with 50% Mg and 50% Fe
Please do not forget to cite in your publications the original paper of these optical constant measurements:
- Jaeger, Mutschke, Begemann, Dorschner, Henning (1994) A&A 292, 641-655
- Dorschner, Begemann, Henning, Jaeger, Mutschke (1995) A&A 300, 503-520.
File was made with the makedustopac.py code by Cornelis Dullemond using the bhmie.py Mie code of Bohren and 
Huffman (python version by Cornelis Dullemond, from original bhmie.f code by Bruce Draine)
Prameter: Grain size =  1.000000e-05 cm; Material density =  3.710 g/cm^3

dustkapp_MRN20.inp is calculated by dsharp_opac (https://github.com/birnstiel/dsharp_opac), which is developed by T. Birnstiel. 
The ice fraction is 20 wt%; the dust size distribution follows 
Mathis, Rumpl, Nordsieck, The Astrophysical Journal, Vol. 217, p. 425-433 (1977). 
When you use the table, please cite Birnstiel et al. 2018. 
In addition, please cite Henning & Stognienko (1996), Draine 2003, Warren & Brandt (2008) for the optical constants. 
Plese see Birnstiel et al. 2018 for the detail.


Molecular line:
molecule_c18o.inp and molecule_c3h2.inp are taken from LAMDA (Leiden Atomic and Molecular Database; https://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~moldata/). When you use this data and the database, follow the citation rule decribed in LAMDA webpage.
