# ***envos***

## 1. Introduction
**Env**elope **O**bservation **S**imulator, developed by Shoji Mori.
This code executes synthetic observation by calculating physical model of young circumstellar systems (i.e. envelope and disk).

I really welcome improvements and requests from users. 

## 2. Features

1. **Flexible Model Generation**: `envos` enables users to generate models based on built-in models or numerical simulation data. The built-in models are available for each of the three regions, where the chosen models are combined into a physical model:
   - **Inner Envelope**: The Ulrich-Cassen-Moosman (UCM) model, a solution for the collapse of a rotating isothermal cloud core, based on the ballistic model of Ulrich (1976).
   - **Outer Envelope**: The Terebey-Shu-Cassen (TSC) model, which represents a self-similar solution of an isothermal sphere collapsing under its own gravity.
   - **Disk**: A power-law plus exponential-tail model, capable of representing a protoplanetary disk with specified mass, outer radius, scale height, and temperature.

2. **Consistent Temperature Structure**: `envos` calculates the temperature structure in a manner consistent with the provided density structure by using RADMC-3D (Dullemond et al. 2012; website: [https://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~dullemond/software/radmc-3d/](https://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~dullemond/software/radmc-3d/); github: [https://github.com/dullemond/radmc3d-2.0](https://github.com/dullemond/radmc3d-2.0)).

3. **Model Analysis**: `envos` offers tools for model analysis, in addition to usual physical structures, including:
   - **Column Density**: `envos` can calculate the column density in various directions (r-, θ-, z-direction, for now). Column density, a measure of the amount of material along a line of sight, is useful to compute optical depths.
   - **Streamlines**: `envos` can generate physical quantities along streamlines and visualize of the sreamlines in the model.

4. **Observational Simulation**: `envos` provides user-friendly tools for performing observational simulations via the RADMC-3D ray-tracing mode, which produces cube data (2 axes of a observational view and 1 axis of a line-of-sight velocity) in general, accounting for the effects of telescope beam size and finte resolution in the velocity. 

5. **Observation Data Analysis**: `envos` provides ways to analyse cube data obtained from simulated observations.
   - **Data Stacking and Slicing**: `envos` can generate integral intensity data, position-velocity data, and line profile data.
   - **Data Correlation**: `envos` can calculate data correlation between two observational data, a measure of the similarity between two data sets. This is particularly useful when comparing simulated and actual observations.

6. **Easy Configuration Management**: `envos` employs a user-friendly configuration system for easy management of parameters, enabling users to conveniently set up and modify their simulations.

7. **Multi-Core Processing**: `envos` is designed to leverage multi-core processing using OpenMP, allowing for efficient computation by parallelizing tasks and distributing them across multiple cores. This feature significantly accelerates the simulation and analysis processes, especially for large and complex models.

8. **Plotting Tools**: `envos` provides a comprehensive set of plotting tools for visualizing models and observation data. These tools can plot gas temperature, density, and velocity profiles, as well as observational outputs such as images and spectral line profiles.

9. **Python 3 Support**: All source codes in `envos` are written in Python 3 (version 3.6 or later), ensuring accessibility to a wide range of users and compatibility with modern Python environments.





<!--

- Density and velocity structures are calculated by a balistic model of Ulrich (1976), or one can input own kinematic data.  
- Temperature structure is calculated consistently with the density structure given by user.
- Calculation of temperature structure and sysnthetic observation is done by RADMC-3D (Dullemond et al. 2012; website: [https://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~dullemond/software/radmc-3d/](https://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~dullemond/software/radmc-3d/); github: [https://github.com/dullemond/radmc3d-2.0](https://github.com/dullemond/radmc3d-2.0)), which is commonly used in astronomical studies.
- All source codes are written in Python3 (ver. >= 3.6).

## 6. Parameters
Easiest way to controll envos is to use a class `envos.Config`.
In `envos.Config`, basic parameters user uses in envos are set.
Users create the instance of the `envos.Config` class setting below parameters and pass it to envos's classes.

Exapmple -- < *parameter name* >: < *type of parameter* > = < *default value* >
